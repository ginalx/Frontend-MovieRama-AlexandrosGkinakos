# MovieRama - yet another movie catalog

MovieRama was built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, css, no frameworks and a few developer dependencies.
ES6 modules where used in order to test with Jest and, as a result,
Browsersync was used to serve the modules and overcome CORS restrictions while developing.
JSDoc was also used for documentation.
